1.1 Artificial Intelligence
The term ’Artificial Intelligence’ was coined in 1956 to denote the study of
developing a computer or software that replicates human capabilities such as
learning and problem solving in order to execute human jobs. Over the last two
decades, technological advances in computing, hardware development, and processor performance have helped to overcome barriers to AI development and
evolution. Data can be stored and analyzed quickly and efficiently nowadays
2.1 Data Collection and Preparation
During the data collection along with preparation phase of the nutrition-focused
Dialogflow bot project, important datasets are gathered and structured to enable
different features involving meal planning, BMI calculation, and nutritional information retrieval. This section details the specific actions and factors involved
in this key stage of development.
2.1.1 Nutritional Databases
By thoroughly collecting and formatting these datasets in JSON and CSV formats, we assured strong data integration and usage within the Dialogflow agent.
These datasets are essential for training NLU models, giving correct nutritional
information, and offering individualized dietary advice via the bot interface.
• Description: Accessed detailed information on food items, ingredients,
macro-nutrient compositions (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), micro-nutrients
(vitamins, minerals), and serving sizes.
• Sources: Used credible sources like the USDA Food Composition Databases,nutrition APIs (such as Nutritionix), or curated datasets from research institutes or government bodies.
• Data Format: Obtained nutritional data in structured forms like JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) or CSV (Comma-Separated Values) to facilitate integration and extraction of essential information.
2.1.2 User Input Example
Created a collection containing user inquiries and intentions regarding nutrition,
meal planning, BMI calculation, calorie requirements, portion sizes, and dietary
advice.
